# Interactive-Selection-for-Image-Dehazing
Image dehazing improves visibility and enhances image quality in hazy or polluted conditions by restoring the original radiance of the scene, resulting in clearer and visually appealing images for better interpretation.

## Requirements

- python 3.10
- Pillow 10.0.0
- torch 2.2.1+cu121
- torchvision 0.17.1+cu121
- torchmetrics 1.3.1
- scikit-image 0.22.0
 - tk 0.1.0

## Models

#### 1. AODNet
AODNet is a deep learning architecture specifically designed for dehazing and is implemented as a neural network. Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) Optimiser is the optimization algorithm used for training. In each iteration, it computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.

#### 2. VGG16
VGG16 is a convolutional neural network architecture that is widely used in computer vision tasks. Here VGG16 model was used as a base, and four custom convolution layers were added at the end. The outputs of these custom layers were concatenated to give the final output.

#### 3. ResNet18
ResNet18 is a convolutional neural network architecture known for its residual connections, which help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. Similar to the VGG16 model, it was used as a base, and four custom convolution layers were added. The same function was performed as with the VGG16 model.

## Dataset
A dataset consisting of Multispectral Satellite Images was used which were captured by an ISRO satellite.
- It contains 1200 images.
- Images are of size 512x512 pixels.
- It contains 960 training images, 135 testing images and 105 validation images.
